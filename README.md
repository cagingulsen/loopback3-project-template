# Project Name

Project description.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install Node.js first. To test if Node is properly installed, type the following in your computers terminal:

```
node -v
```

Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm. However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node does, so you'll want to make sure it's the latest version.

```
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installing

First, you should clone the project from the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:accountname/projectname.git
```

Then you should install node modules. Use the command:
```
npm install
```

To run the application, use:

```
npm start
```

The app should be running on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

To use API:

- If you are using an IDE, you can run in debug mode and browse the API using LoopBack API Explorer at: [http://localhost:4000/explorer](http://localhost:4000/explorer).

- You can send HTTP request to the server using the following example: [http://localhost:4000/api/modelName](http://localhost:4000/api/modelName)


## Running the tests

To run automated tests, you should use the command

```
npm test
```

### And coding style tests

'npm test' command automatically runs coding style tests. When developing, you can define a keyboard shortcut at your IDE and run ESLint auto fix feature.
